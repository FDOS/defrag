Yes you are in the right place. And yes, I am slow in responding
to e-mail.

I am Gregg Jennings and I certainly will allow you to use the
DISKLIB code. I am quite familiar with the GPL but I have my own
license which should be part of the DISKLIB archive. If it is too
vague let me state unequivocably (sp?) that you or FreeDOS or anyone
else can use the DISKLIB code for anything.

I am familiar with FreeDOS although it has been a while since I have
looked at your stuff. I wish you and FreeDOS well.

Peace,
Gregg Jennings
