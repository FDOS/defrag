$[CENTER](Sorting directory entries)
$(-)

Right before starting to optimize the drive the directory
entries are sorted. Sorting the directory entries does not
hurt the long file names.

Sorting can be done by the following criteria:
- file name
- file extension
- date&time
- file size

Sorting can be ascending or descending.
